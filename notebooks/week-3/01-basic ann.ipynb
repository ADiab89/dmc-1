    "Here we will build a very rudimentary Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and use it to solve some basic classification problems. This example is implemented using only basic math and linear algebra functions, which will allow us to study how each aspect of the network works, and to gain an intuitive understanding of its functions. In future labs we will use pre-built libraries such as Keras which automate and optimize much of these functions, making the network much faster and easier to use.\n",

Please review the [first chapter](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap1.html) of the book for a thorough explanation of the code."

Finally, we split the data set into training and testing sets, and convert the targets of the training set to 'one-hot' encoding (OHE). OHE takes each piece of categorical data and converts it to a list of binary values the length of which is equal to the number of categories, and the position of the current category denoted with a '1' and '0' for all others. For example, in our dataset we have 3 possible categories: versicolor, virginica, and setosa. After applying OHE, versicolor becomes [1,0,0], virginica becomes [0,1,0], and setosa becomes [0,0,1].

    "The code below uses the Pandas data library to import this `.csv` file as a Pandas 'data frame'. This is a convenient way for importing and visualizing tabular data. In this case, the file does not include headers for the columns, so we can also use pandas to specify the column names based on the documentation. You can use Pandas data frames in a similar way to numpy formatted arrays. The last two lines of code split the data into feature and target sets. From there you should be able to work with the data set in a similar way as we did for the Iris data above. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember to split the data into both training and test sets, and encode the training targets as one-hot vectors. When you create the network, make sure to specify the proper dimensions for the input and output layer. You can also experiment with different sizes for the hidden layer. If you are not achieving good results, try changing the parameters for the number of epochs, size of mini-batch, and learning rate in the SGD function call. Within 30 epochs, you should be able to achieve an accuracy of at least XX."
